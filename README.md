Repo for Socially Assistive Robots as therapeutic intervention in Comorbid ADHD/ASD populations

# Abstract
In this work, we explore prior research on clinical studies for Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and Austim Spectrum Disorder(ASD) to identify evidence-based psychosocial interventions to inform the integration of Socially assistive Robotics (SAR) into technology-based therapeutic interventions in two subtypes of Neurodevelopmental Disorder (NDD) populations: comorbid ASD and ADHD and college students with ADHD.
